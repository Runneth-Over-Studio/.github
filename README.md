# Runneth Over Studio

Founded for the under-served young-adult/adult Christian in the gaming space. Mature games that can be lots of fun tend to glorify objectionable things while contemporary Christian games seem to largely be created with an attitude of strictly needing to be suitable for Sunday school. I don't believe that either of those have to be rules. For over a millennium Christians have made some of the most enduring and evocative art. My goal is to contribute to that tradition of expression, through the exploration of themes and allegory.
