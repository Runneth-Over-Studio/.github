# Runneth Over Studio

Founded for the under-served young-adult/adult Christian in the gaming space. Mature games that can be lots of fun tend to glorify objectionable things while contemporary Christian games seem to largely be created with an attitude of strictly needing to be suitable for Sunday school. I don't believe that either of those have to be rules. For over a millennium Christians have made some of the most enduring and evocative art. My goal is to contribute to that tradition of expression, through the exploration of themes and allegory.

Modus Operandi
--------------

> "What we want is not more little books about Christianity, but more little books by Christians on other subjects – with their Christianity latent." — C.S. Lewis

- **Work Heartily**
  - *Colossians 3:23*
  - First and foremost, we strive to point to the glory of God in everything we produce.

- **Give Cheerfully**
  - *2 Corinthians 9:7*
   - We are publicly committed to donating 10% of all profits to charities and other non-profits.

- **Be Unashamed**
  - *2 Timothy 2:15*
  - Professionally handle themes with care and reverence.

- **Live Quietly**
  - *1 Thessalonians 4:11*
   - Simply make the best games we can. Focus on the work and in a manner that on its own demonstrates our values.
